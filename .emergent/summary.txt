The previous AI engineer's work primarily revolved around expanding administrative and agent-specific functionalities, starting with public pages. Key feature additions included an Onboarding Wizard, Organization Settings, enhanced Admin Dashboard, Agent Dashboard, My Profile, and a complex Add/Edit Deal workflow, alongside My Reviews for reputation management. A recurring challenge was maintaining consistent navigation and addressing user feedback on design. The trajectory shows multiple iterations of design overhauls, from an initial yellow/amber theme to a professional blue, then a minimalist monochrome+green, and finally, a custom user-defined palette. Persistent CSS errors (extra braces in ) and hardcoded color classes repeatedly hindered design consistency, requiring extensive refactoring and bulk replacements across the codebase. Mock data was consistently used throughout, anticipating backend integration.

The AgentRate platform is a real estate marketplace connecting users with buyer agents and property deals, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It supports multi-tenancy (Admin, Staff, Public). The core problem is conversion optimization through a professional, intuitive, and consistent user experience.

**Implemented features include:**
*   **Public-facing:** Agent/Deal Listings, Agent/Deal Detail pages, Compare Agents, Reviews, Home page.
*   **Agency Admin & Staff:**
    *   Onboarding Wizard.
    *   Org Settings (business info, coverage, privacy, lead routing).
    *   Admin Dashboard (staff management, performance metrics, nudges).
    *   Agent Dashboard (agent-specific metrics, quick links).
    *   My Profile (editable profile with public preview).
    *   My Deals (manage deal portfolio, filters, search, actions, accurate public preview).
    *   Add/Edit Deal Workflow (multi-step form for deal creation/editing).
    *   My Reviews (manage reviews, reply, share links, list New, Published, Flagged).

All frontend features leverage mock data, with a future .NET Core backend planned. A continuous effort has been made to refine the application's visual design, moving towards a user-friendly and professional aesthetic, culminating in a custom brand palette.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a comprehensive design system refresh. Following user dissatisfaction with the previous minimalist black/white/green theme, the user provided a detailed, custom brand palette featuring Primary (Indigo 600), Accent A (Teal 500), Accent B (Amber 600 for highlights), Neutrals (Slate 900, 700, 500, 200), Feedback colors (Green, Red, Blue), and specific Dark Theme counterparts.

The AI engineer has accepted this new custom palette and has just completed updating the core styling files:
1.  ** (Chat Message 467):** The global CSS variables were modified to incorporate the colors of the new custom palette.
2.  ** (Chat Message 471, 473):** This file, which centralizes theme definitions, was completely recreated/rewritten to exclusively contain the new custom brand palette provided by the user.

The current state is that the foundational style definitions for the new design system have been applied. The frontend server is about to be restarted to render the application with these extensive design changes. The immediate goal is to verify that this new, detailed color scheme is correctly and consistently reflected across the entire application, making it user-friendly, intuitive, and professional as per the user's latest input.

Restart the frontend to apply the new custom design system and visually verify its implementation across all pages.
