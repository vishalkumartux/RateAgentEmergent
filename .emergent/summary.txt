The AI engineer's work primarily focused on expanding the AgentRate platform's administrative and agent-specific functionalities, building upon existing public-facing pages. The trajectory showcases an iterative development process, with a strong emphasis on user feedback and visual verification via screenshots.

Key phases included implementing a multi-role aware navigation, developing an Onboarding Wizard for first-time admins, and a comprehensive Organization Settings page. Significant effort was dedicated to enhancing the Admin Dashboard with staff management, performance metrics, and nudges, including mock data adjustments to demonstrate features. Subsequently, a distinct Agent Dashboard was created for individual agents. The most complex recent work involved building My Profile and My Deals pages for agents/admins, which necessitated multiple refactoring rounds to align with public data models, ensure consistent design, and refine the Add/Edit Deal workflow, including a true public-view preview functionality. Navigation and routing issues were a recurring theme, addressed by explicit header updates and  modifications, often requiring frontend restarts to propagate changes. Mock data was heavily leveraged throughout, anticipating a .NET Core backend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with refining the Add/Edit Deal workflow and ensuring consistent, user-friendly navigation across all Agent/Admin sections. Specifically, the request was to bind the new  page for editing existing deals, ensure View options lead to the deal detail page (), and Edit options open the  workflow. An edit option should also be present on the deal detail page.

The engineer has just completed the following actions:
1.  ** Update (Chat Message 330):** The component was updated to correctly differentiate between View (linking to ) and Edit (linking to ) actions for individual deals.
2.  ** Update (Chat Message 332, 334):** The deal detail page for agents was enhanced to include an Edit button and an improved action sidebar, facilitating direct access to the  workflow from the detail view.
3.  **Documentation (Chat Message 336):** A new document, , was created to summarize the refined navigation structure for agent and admin users.
4.  **Restart Frontend (Chat Message 337):** The frontend server was restarted to apply the latest changes to the navigation and components.

The current state is that the navigation flow for viewing and editing deals from the My Deals list and Deal Details page has been implemented, and a guide has been created. The frontend was just restarted.
