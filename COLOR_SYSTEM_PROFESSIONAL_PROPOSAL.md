- Build confidence and trust

- Work for $500K-$5M+ properties

---

## Primary Palette

### 1. Deep Navy Blue (Primary Brand)
**Light Mode:** `#1E40AF` (blue-800)
**Dark Mode:** `#3B82F6` (blue-500)

**Why:** Neutral, sophisticated, doesn't compete with content.

### 3. Muted Teal (Accent - Sparingly)
**Light Mode:** `#0F766E` (teal-700)
**Dark Mode:** `#5EEAD4` (teal-300)

**Usage:**
- Secondary actions
- Informational badges

## Accent Colors (Use Sparingly)

### Option A: Refined Gold (Subtle Luxury)

**Dark Mode:** `#FDE047` (yellow-300)

**Usage:**

**Usage:**

## User Psychology

### Why This Matters for Real Estate:

**Color Psychology Research:**
- 85% of buyers say color is primary reason for purchase decision
