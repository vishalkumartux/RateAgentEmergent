# Admin Dashboard Improvements - October 2024

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Improved Invite Form Layout

**Problem:** Email field and role dropdown were not aligned properly, making the form look cluttered.

**Solution:** 
- Changed from `flex` layout to `grid` layout with 12 columns
- Email field: 7 columns (58% width)
- Role dropdown: 4 columns (33% width)  
- Remove button: 1 column (8% width)
- Better spacing with `gap-3`
- Improved placeholder text: "colleague@example.com"
- Changed remove icon from `X` to `Trash2` for clarity
- Added hover states with red background for delete button

**Before:**
```
[Email Field............................] [Dropdown] [X]
```

**After:**
```
[Email Field (wider)........] [Role Dropdown] [üóëÔ∏è]
```

### 2. Removed Duplicate Organization Settings Tab

**Problem:** The Admin Dashboard had an "Organization Settings" tab that duplicated the dedicated Organization Settings page at `/admin/settings`.

**Solution:**
- Removed the 4th tab completely
- Changed from 4-column grid to 3-column grid for tabs
- Renamed "Pending Invites" tab to "Invite & Manage" for better clarity
- Removed unused state variables and functions related to org editing

**Before:**
```
[Overview] [Staff Management] [Pending Invites] [Organization Settings]
```

**After:**
```
[Overview] [Staff Management] [Invite & Manage]
```
